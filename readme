Purpose: To Practice designing a class that can be used in many applications. To Write and implement a thorough test plan. You are NOT to use any of the Java API date classes (Gregorian calendar, Date...)

Write a class to hold data and perform operations on dates. Ie: January 2, 2015 or 3/15/2015

On Paper, design the cass to hold a valid date. First Decide what fields you will need.

Then decide what operation you will perform on the fields, what functionality the class Date will have.

You must include a toString(), an equals() and compareTo() method.

Methods required in addition to the constructor methods, the toString(), equals(), and compareTo() methods.

Public Date add(int numDays)

Public Date subtract(int numDays)

Public int daysBetween(Date anotherDate)

Public String getDate(char format)
